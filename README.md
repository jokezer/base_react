# React Base Orders Application

Base react demo application builded with [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). The internal data flow is handled with  [Reflux](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs) and the routing is managed with the [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router).

<!-- ####[Demo](http://wbkd.github.io/react-starterkit) -->
This starterkit does not include some fancy UI stuff but is a lightweight starting point for your next react app.

## Get the kit

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wbkd/react-starterkit.git && cd react-starterkit
```

## Installation

Install all dependencies. 

```
$ npm install
```


## Development

Builds the application and starts a webserver with livereload. By default the webserver starts at port 1337.
You can define a port with `$ gulp --port 3333`.

```
$ npm start
```

## Build

Builds a minified version of the application in the dist folder.

```
$ gulp build --type production
```

## Testing

We use [jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) to test our application.<br />
You can run the tests that are defined under [app/scripts/\_\_tests__](./app/scripts/__tests__) with

```
$ npm test

```
